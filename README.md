What in the world does easypage do? Well, on the most basic level, it takes a file with bbcode, and displays it.
Simple. In fact, there are already tons of things that do this probably.
However, this also offers encryption, and you can edit files.
<ul>
<li>Encryption, as in you have to enter a password in order to unlock the contents of the file.</li>
<li>Edit files, as in there is a way to login as an admin and edit/create the text files.</li>
</ul>
Note
=======
This was intended mainly for my use, but I put it up in case someone else might find it useful.
Because of this, customization and other things may be slightly harder, and there is no easy install script.
If you want me to make one, please create an issue, and I'll attend to it ASAP :)

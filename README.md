Make webpages easy
about

What in the world does easypage do? Well, on the most basic level, it takes a file with text formatting(ohnxCode, or oC, for more information see guide.txt), and displays it.
Note
=======
This was intended mainly for my use, but I put it up in case someone else might find it useful.
Because of this, customization and other things may be slightly harder, and there is no easy install script.
If you want me to make one, please create an issue, and I'll attend to it ASAP :)
Known setup requirements:
If you are on linux, you must chmod the directory "files" to 755, or 777.
(eg chmod 755 files/ )

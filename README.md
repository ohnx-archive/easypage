What in the world does easypage do?
Well, on the most basic level, it takes a file with bbcode, and displays it.
Simple. In fact, there are already tons of things that do this probably.
However, this also offers encryption, and you can edit files.
-Encryption, as in you have to enter a password in order to unlock the contents of the file.
-Edit files, as in there is a way to login as an admin and edit/create the text files.
